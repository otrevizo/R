This dataset is a cleaned-up subset of a database used for one of the data mining competitions 
from the late 90's.  It is based on the results from a fund raising appeal by one of the US
non-for-profit direct mail fund raising organizations (aka study sponsor).  The goal of this 
modeling exercise was to predict donors' contributions in response to a particular direct 
mailing campaign based on their demographics (age and gender) and available history of
contributions they have made in the past.  The limitations associated with the use of this data
for educational purposes preclude disclosure of more specific details about its source.

For the purposes of this week problem set only the entries for the donors that have responded
to that specific campaign have been selected, large number of less informative or highly 
correlated variables have been removed and the resulting data has been further cleaned up
by omitting entries with missing values for any of the predictors used.

The final data file fund-raising.csv has one row per donor and includes the following
comma-separated columns:

* contrib     -- the outcome that the model is expected to predict: the donation  
                 amount ($) associated with the response to the mailing campaign of interest
* gapmos      -- number of months between first and second contributions from this donor
* promocontr  -- total number of contributions to promotional mailing campaigns
* mincontrib  -- dollar amount of this donor smallest contribution to date
* ncontrib    -- total number of contributions by this donor
* maxcontrib  -- dollar amount of this donor largest contribution to date
* lastcontr   -- dollar amount of this donor most recent contribution
* avecontr    -- average dollar amount of this donor contribution
* mailord     -- total number of times the donor has responded to a mail order
                 offer other than the study sponsor's
* mindate     -- date (YYMM) of this donor smallest contribution
* maxdate     -- date (YYMM) of this donor largest contribution
* age         -- donor age
* gender      -- donor gender
